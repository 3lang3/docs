# ðŸ”Œ Connectors

## Introduction

### What is a connector?

_Connectors_ play a critical role in Logto. With their help, Logto enables end-users to use SMS-based or email-based passwordless registration and the capabilities of signing in with social accounts. With the increasing popularity of websites and applications, passwordless and social sign-ins allow users to avoid managing numerous accounts and passwords.

Sounds fascinating :hushed:, Uh? See [Configure connectors](../../recipes/configure-connectors/) if you want to set up an existing connector. If you can not find the connector you want to set up, you may develop those connectors by following the guides in [Create your connector](../../recipes/create-your-connector/).

## Compositions

_Connectors_ are stored both locally and remotely:

<ConnectorStorageIntro />

## Connector's local storage: _ConnectorMetadata_

### id

_**id**_ is an _unique_ string-typed key to identify connector in Logto.

It's assigned by the developers of each connector and will be uploaded to DB.

### target

_**target**_ is a lowercase string to distinguish the social identities source of the social connector.
For email and SMS connectors, _**target**s_ work more like a "human readable id".

For example, both _WeChat web connector_ and _WeChat native connector_'s _**target**_ are `wechat`. _Aliyun direct mail connector_'s _**target**_ is `aliyun-dm` and _Aliyun SMS connector_'s _**target**_ is `aliyun-sms`.

### type

_**type**_ should be one of the following connector types:

<ConnectorTypeIntro />

### platform

_**platform**_ should be one of the following values:

<ConnectorPlatformIntro />

### name

_**name**_ is a Javascript/Typescript object whose keys are i18n country codes and values are connectors' display name.

### logo

_**logo**_ is an URL or relative path of connector's logo (light mode by default).

### logoDark

_**logo**_ is an _nullable_ URL or relative path of connector's dark mode logo.

:::note
Usually, _**logo**s_ always exist, and _**logoDark**s_ only exist for some exceptional cases when the light mode logos may become obscure in dark mode.
:::

### description

_**description**_ is also a Javascript/Typescript object whose keys are i18n country codes and values are brief connector descriptions.

### readme

_**readme**_ is a relative path of the connector's README markdown file whose contexts will show up during set-up.

### configTemplate

_**configTemplate**_ is a relative path of the connector's configuration example.

## Connector's remote storage: _Connector DB_

### id

_**id**_ is an _unique_ string-typed key to identify connector in DB and is **the only bridge** to align _Connector DB_ and _ConnectorMetadata_.

### enabled

_**enabled**_ is a boolean variable whose default value is `FALSE`. It is the switch to control whether a connector is in use or not.

Configured and working connectors can be shut down by simply switching _**enabled**_ from `TRUE` to `FALSE`.

### config

_**config**_ could be an arbitrary non-empty object.

It is where a connector store its configuration. Each connector have different properties in _**config**_ and it obligated to be valid (connectors have different standard for "valid".) before being saved to DB.

Developers are required to implement a _**config**_ guard when developing their own connectors, see [Create your connector](../../recipes/create-your-connector/) for more details.

Want to have a glance at _**config**_ samples? Go to [Configure connectors](../../recipes/configure-connectors/) or each connector's settings page.

:::note
In current Logto version (V1.0), only one _SMS/Email_ connector can be "enabled" at the same time, which means _**enabled**_ is set to be `TRUE`, all other connectors with same type are automatically set _**enabled**_ to be `FALSE`.

This "only one working _SMS/Email_ connector" rule is not applicable to _Social_ connectors.

### createdAt

_**createdAt**_ is a auto-generated timestamp string.
