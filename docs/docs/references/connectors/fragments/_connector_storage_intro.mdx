- **Local storage**, also known as _ConnectorMetadata_, is a Javascript/Typescript object containing fixed properties such as logo, connector type, and so on. (Having trouble understanding these properties :face_with_monocle:? No worry, a detailed explanation comes later!)
- **Remote storage** is stored in DB for the sake of relatively frequent changes on those data.
