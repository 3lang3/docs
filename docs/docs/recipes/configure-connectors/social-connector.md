# Social Connector

Suppose you are now on the "Connectors" page in Admin Console. Go to the "Social connectors" tab and add a new connector to enter the configuration process.

:::tip
You may find that some connectors do not have a secondary choice of platform, such as Google, Facebook, and GitHub. These connectors' _platform_ are _Universal_. Explore _platform_ description (TODO: add a link here after connector reference merged) to know more.

Choose a proper _platform_ from either _Web_ or _Native_ for connectors to fit your use case.<br/>
You can set up a single _Native_ connector w/o adding a _Web_ connector if you only provide native mobile apps and vice versa.
:::

Follow the README to compose the connector config JSON with little effort.

See [how to enable social sign-in](../../tutorials/get-started/enable-social-sign-in.mdx) to bring your social connector into use.
