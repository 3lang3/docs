# SMS or Email Connector

Suppose you are now on the "Connectors" page in Admin Console. Click the _Set up_ button and select an SMS or Email connector to enter the configuration process.

Follow the README on the left and compose the connector config JSON in the text input box on your right. You can check whether the config can work before saving changes.

You can change the current SMS or Email connector in the top-right corner on the connector details page, where a review of the connector README is also available.

:::note
You can bring ONLY ONE _SMS Connector_ (or _Email Connector_) "alive".

If you change the "living" SMS or Email connector and save changes, the previous SMS or Email connector will be disabled automatically. Also, the config of past connectors will lose track.<br/>
You may keep the old connectors' config properly if you want to switch back to those connectors in the future.

You can check out [how to enable SMS or email passcode sign-in](../../tutorials/get-started/enable-passcode-sign-in.mdx) as soon as you finish the setup.
