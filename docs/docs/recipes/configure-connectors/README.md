# ðŸª› Configure connectors

_Connectors_ are the bridge between Logto and other third-party vendors who provide short message service (SMS), email service, or user information on wildly accepted social media.

Logto provides you with many connectors to give end-users access to third-party providers. Such as Google, GitHub, Facebook, SendGrid mail, etc.

You may feel annoyed when using such robust connectors? :sob:

Don't worry, this doc will show you an easy way to have things done!

## :watch: Kick-off :zap:

Let's start from [Admin Console](https://logto.dev/console), signing in with your Logto account ("admin" access needed). You may [create an admin account](../../tutorials/get-started/#create-an-admin-account) if you don't have one.

Click the **Connectors** button on the sidebar :neutral_face:

:ghost:**Welcome to the world of _connectors_**:ghost:

_Connectors_ can be classified into three types: _SMS Connector_, _Email Connector_ and _Social Connector_. See [connector reference](../../references/connectors/README.md) for more details about **connector type**.

You can continue setting up _Email connector_ or _SMS connector_, and need to go to "Social connectors" tab before adding _Social connector_.

:::note
Move on to detailed guides for different connector types' configuration: [**_SMS or Email connector_**](./sms-or-email-connector.md) or [**_Social connector_**](./social-connector.md).
