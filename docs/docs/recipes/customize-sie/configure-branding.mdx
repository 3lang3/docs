# Configure branding

## Dark mode

The *Enable dark mode* switch controls if the UI has a "dark feeling" when Logto detects related system preference.

## Brand color

*Brand color (Dark)* will affect the primary color of components, including but not limited to buttons, links, etc. Feel free to replace the Logto purple-blue with your brand color.

If dark mode is enabled, you'll see an additional brand color input named *Brand color (Dark)*.

## Branding area

This section is pretty straightforward. Change something to see what happens.
