# üßë‚Äçüî¨ Create your connector

Connectors play a critical role in Logto. With their help, Logto enables end-users to use SMS-based and email-based passwordless registration and sign-in capabilities using social accounts. With the increasing popularity of websites and applications, passwordless and social sign-ins allow users to avoid managing numerous accounts and passwords every day.

:::note
Currently, Logto has provided many widely used social sign-in connectors such as WeChat, Alipay, Google, Facebook, etc., and SMS or email connectors such as AliCloud, SendGrid, and Twilio. They should be able to satisfy most users' needs at this stage, but Logto will not stop making progress. We will provide more connectors for use in the future, and if you have urgent needs, you can also develop your connectors, and we welcome you to share your developed connectors with the whole community.

In Admin Console, click the "Connectors" tab on the left, and you'll see a page with two tabs on the top of the panel.

In the first tab, you can create an Email connector or SMS connector by clicking the corresponding "Set Up" button, which will bring you to a two-column page with a detailed step-by-step guide on the left and a text input box to configure connector settings. After finishing the configuration, you can use the tester to check whether the settings function well.

In the second tab, you can start to add a social connector by clicking the "Add Social Connector" button. Select the connector you want to add and move on by clicking "Next". For Alipay and WeChat connector, you may find a secondary _platform_ option for choosing Web or Native. In contrast, other connectors' default platform is Universal by default. You will be on a two-column page with a step-by-step guide left and a text input box on your right for settings.

TODO: Add a link to reference for the explanation of different platform types.
