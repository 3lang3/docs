# 🧑‍🚀 Manage users

User management is the core feature for the admin staff.

For example, you want to:

- View the activities of a user whose phone number is "12345678901" to find out when their account has been stolen.
- Correct the illegal avatar of a user who signed up with the email "pedophilia@exmaple.com".
- Help a user whose `username` is "forgetful-man" reset the password that they forget.
- Delete a user named "John Doe" who has violated the terms of service.
- ……

You can do it all:

- on the [Admin Console page](./on-admin-console-page.md),
- or by [Management API](./by-management-api.md).

Most conveniently, [integrate your data with Logto user data](./on-storage.md), and you don't even need to create your user table!
