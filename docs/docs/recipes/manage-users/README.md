# 🧑‍🚀 Manage users

For example:

- According to a screenshot containing the user's avatar and full name, search by the full name, filter by the avatar, and finally, find their account.
- Find the newly registered users yesterday, view their profile, custom data, and social connections, analyze their behavior and make necessary return visits.
- An employee leaves your company. To protect the company's data security, clear the employee's social sign-in information, reset their password, or even delete their account directly.
- Help a user reset the password that they forget.
- ……

You can do it all:

- on the [Admin Console page](./on-admin-console-page.md),
- or by [Management API](./by-management-api.md).

And [integrate your data with Logto user data](./on-storage.md).
