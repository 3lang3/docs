# 🧑‍🚀 Manage users

For example:

- Search a user by their full name, phone, or email, and locate them by glancing at the avatar with your eyes.
- Find a user, and view their profile, custom data, and social connections.
- Clear a user's social sign-in information, reset their password, or even delete their account directly.
- Help a user reset the password that they forget.
- ……

You can do it all using:

- [Admin Console](./on-admin-console-page.md)
- [Management API](./by-management-api.md)

And [integrate your data with Logto user data](./on-storage.md). TODO: @sijie
