# 🧑‍🚀 Manage users

You can access Logto user data using [Admin Console](./using-admin-console.md) or [Management API](./using-management-api.md).

With the help of them can do something like these:

- Search users by full name, phone, or email, and view their profile, including username, avatar, social connections, etc.
- Unbind a user's social identity from Facebook, or even delete their account directly in extreme cases.
- Help a user reset the password.
- [Integrate your data with Logto user data](./on-storage.md). TODO: @sijie
