# 🧑‍🚀 Manage users

The Logto user data can come from various sources, including Logto itself and social identity providers, e.g., Google, Facebook, and WeChat.

You can access Logto user data using [Admin Console](./on-admin-console-page.md) or [Management API](./by-management-api.md).

You can do something on user data like these:

- Search a user by their full name, phone, or email, and view their profile, including username, avatar, social connections, custom data, etc.
- Unbind a user's social identity from Facebook, or even delete their account directly.
- Help a user reset the password.
- [Integrate your data with Logto user data](./on-storage.md). TODO: @sijie
