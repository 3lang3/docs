# 🧑‍🚀 Manage users

For example, you want to:

- View the activities of a user whose phone number is "12345678901".
- Update the profile of a user whose username is "peter_pan".
- Help a user reset the password that they forget.
- Delete a user named "John Doe".
- ……

You can do it all:

- on the [Admin Console page](./on-admin-console-page.md),
- or by [Management API](./by-management-api.md).

And [integrate your data with Logto user data](./on-storage.md).
