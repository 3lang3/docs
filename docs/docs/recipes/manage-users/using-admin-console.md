# Manage users using Admin Console

## List and search users

In Admin Console, click the **User Management** tab on the left, and you'll see a user table view on the right.

There are three columns in the table:

- **User**: The user info may include the avatar, full name, username, phone number, email, etc.
- **From application**: The name of the application that the user initially registered.
- **Latest sign in**: The timestamp when the user signed in last time.

Input a keyword in the search box above the user table, click the "Search" button, and you'll see the matching users in the table.

Support the exact partial search on the following user properties:

- name,
- username,
- email,
- or phone number.
