# Manage users using Admin Console

## List and search users

In Admin Console, click the **User Management** tab on the left, and you'll see a user table view on the right.

There are three columns in the table:

- **User**: The user info may include the avatar, full name, username, phone number, email, etc.
- **From application**: The name of the application that the user initially registered.
- **Latest sign in**: The timestamp when the user signed in last time.

Input a keyword in the search box above the user table, click the "Search" button, and you'll see the matching users in the table.

Support the partial search on the user properties: name, username, email, or phone number.

## Add user

Admin users could create a new account through Admin Console in the name of an end-user.

1. On the "User Management" panel, click the "+ Add User" button.
2. In the dialog, fill out the username and full name, and click the "Add User" button to confirm.
3. After successfully adding, click the eye icon to show or hide the actual password.
4. Copy the **username** and **initial password** to send to the end-user.

:::caution
After closing the "Add User" dialog, you can no longer view the password.
If you forget to keep it, you have to [reset the password](#reset-user-password).
